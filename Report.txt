For the fuzzy recocgnition, Please feel free to ask it anything about dolphins, I promise ive covered as much as possible making it so it works very well in my opinon
When connecting and finding best answers i had the bot out put the matching questions (C. of question 6) but the regex has been made assure it wont have problems. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHASE 2
For Phase 2 of the FAQ i chose to do named entity and noun chunks, covering everything from COMMANDS, QUESTIONS AND GREETINGS now all are needs for a bot like this but i think the logic plays more of a role in the command section, where if you tell the robot a command like "Make me a coffee", It will respond with your verb, det and noun to respond as humanly as possible, and it takes other percautions assuming you didnt use all 3 (verb, det and noun). it can also greet the user.

PHASE 3 (I beleive this is the way to link it) (If it helps i havent changed anything about the bot, but this link is new just to make sure)
